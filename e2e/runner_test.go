// rejectionHeadroom multiplies the instruction budget and the resource fee of
// a submission that exists to be rejected on-chain.
//
// The scenarios that expect a refusal cannot size their resources from an
// enforcing simulation — that pass fails locally for the very reason under
// test, which would prove only that simulation agrees with the host. Their
// resources come from the recording pass instead, which never executed the
// account's __check_auth and therefore under-counts. Submitting those numbers
// unchanged produces a transaction that runs out of instructions before it
// reaches the check the scenario is about, and "passes" for a reason that has
// nothing to do with what it claims to prove: scenario E once did exactly
// that (see e2e/README.md, "What each scenario proves").
//
// The value is insurance, not the control. It was measured, not assumed: for
// the classic-account threshold check (scenario C-control), headroom 1 was
// already sufficient — reverting it still produced "signature weight is lower
// than threshold", because verifying a classic account signature is far
// cheaper than executing a custom account contract's __check_auth, which is
// what exhausted the budget in scenario E. What makes both rejection scenarios
// valid is that they assert the host's specific error, not that they carry
// headroom.

// prepareFunc rewrites the recorded authorization entries between the
// recording pass and signing. It receives the validUntilLedger that will be
// signed over, so a prepare step that changes what gets signed (such as
// wrapping an entry with WithDelegates, which fixes the expiration) can use
// the same value the signer will.
//
// It returns the entries to sign; returning the input unchanged is legal.

// the instruction-headroom fix that scenario E needed is an example where that
// mirroring mattered, and the three copies had already drifted in their error
// handling and logging. Keeping the differences as data is what stops that
// class of drift: there is now one place that decides how a scenario runs.
